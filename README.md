### IDEA:
I have already visualized my layout, hoping I can attain it.

```
=========================
		            20 +
		            400
=========================
|     C     |  <  |  +  |
|  7  |  8  |  9  |  -  |
|  4  |  5  |  6  |  x  |
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  =  |
|  0  |  .  |  /  |  =  |

4 x 5 Grid
first element = takes 2 space Horizontally
last elements = takes 2 space Vertically
```
